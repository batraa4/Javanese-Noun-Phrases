## Research Questions/ Introduction:
What is the DP structure of Javanese? What is the canonical word order of Javanese?

Javanese is a language mainly spoken on the island of Java in Indonesia. This paper aims to explore what the structure of the DP looks like, as well as the canonical word order. Looking at very basic data, it is easy to hypothesize that the DP may look similar to English, other than the fact that the head D may be head-final in the DP. However, I argue that the DP is not as simple as appears to be and may need different types of phrases for different determiners, such as a Demonstrative Phrase, Quantifier Phrase, as well as a DP which can also take possessiveness into account. Last of all, I will also hypothesize and argue that Javanese follows a strict SVO canonical order.
